    6. hsl()
        - It is a method with hue, saturation and lightness.
        - Hue is a value from 0 to 360 deg [angle].
    
                0 to 120 deg          Red
                121 to 240 deg    Green

                100% removes complete gray
    
        - Lightness is a value from 0 to 100%. It is the increase the brightness of color.
    
    Syntax:
          hsl(hue, sat, light)
          hsl(10deg, 50%, 50%)
    Ex:
        {
          color : hsl(10deg, 100%, 50%);
        }
    
    7. hsla()
        - It is a method with hue, saturation, lightness and alpha.
        - Alpha sets transparency from 0 to 1.
    
    Syntax:
         hsla(hue, sat, light, alpha);
         hsla(10deg, 100%, 50%, 0.6);
    
    8. Linear gradient
        - Gradient is a set of multiple colors.
        - Linear is an orientation horizontally and vertically in a sequence.
        - Gradient colors can be applied only as background-image.
    
    Syntax:

        }
    
        - Orientation can be towards top right, top left, bottom right, bottom left, right, left,
           top, bottom and any angle.
